# Project 01 - Part 01 - Insertion, Selection and Bubble

1. Create a class called OrdenacaoLinear and Implement the following linear sorting algorithms in Python using methods:

- InsertionSort
- SelectionSort
- BubbleSort

2. Then create random vectors with integer elements of size 100, 1,000 and 10,000.

3. Run the sorting algorithms in item 4 five times for each input size and save the average execution time of each algorithm for inputs of size 100, 1,000 and 10,000.

4. Plot a graph with the performance of the algorithms from item 1 for each execution time according to the input size. Use graphics libraries:

- Python: MatplotLib (https://matplotlib.org/)
- Vega-Altair (https://altair-viz.github.io/Links to an external site.
- Or another data visualization library of your liking.
