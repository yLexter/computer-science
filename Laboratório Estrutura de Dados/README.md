## Subject Content

- Algorithms: Implementations of essential algorithms for ordering data, both linear and divide and conquer

- Complexity Notation: Understanding and analyzing the temporal and spatial complexity of algorithms is fundamental to the efficiency of any program. This project explores how to evaluate and express complexity in notations such as O(n), Θ(n), Ω(n), among others.

- Stacks and Queues: Implementations of stacks and queues, fundamental data structures for managing data in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) or FIFO (First-In-First-Out) context.

- Linked Lists: Study of single and double linked lists, including insertion, removal and search in linked lists.

- Binary Trees: Exploration of binary trees, including binary search trees (BSTs), tree traversal, insertion and deletion.

- Hash Tables: Implementations of hash tables, data structures that allow fast access to data through hash functions.

## How to use

This repository contains a series of directories, each related to a specific topic. Within each directory, you will find example codes, exercise resolutions, and solutions for the corresponding topics.
