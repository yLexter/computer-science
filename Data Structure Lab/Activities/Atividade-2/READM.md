# Continued Activity I

1. Create a class called OrdenacaoRecursiva and Implement the following sorting algorithms based on divide and conquer in Python using methods:

- MergeSort
- QuickSort

2. Then create random vectors with integer elements of size 100, 1,000 and 10,000.

3. Run the sorting algorithms from item 1 five times for each input size and save the average execution time of each algorithm for inputs of size 100, 1,000 and 10,000.

4. Plot a graph with the performance of the algorithms from item 1 for each execution time according to the input size. Use graphics libraries:

- Python: MatplotLib (https://matplotlib.org/)
- Vega-Altair (https://altair-viz.github.io/Links to an external site.

Or another data visualization library of your liking.

5. Finally, plot a new graph comparing the performance of the linear algorithms (from part 01 of the project) and recursive algorithms implemented. Analyze this new graph and interpret your results in a technical way.
