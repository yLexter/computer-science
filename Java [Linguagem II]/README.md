# Programming Language II

This repository is dedicated to the Programming Language II discipline, where we explore the principles and topics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). Below are some of the topics covered and their respective exercise resolutions:

## Teacher
- **Teacher:** Wellington

## Subject Content

- **Classes and Objects:** We explore creating classes and instantiating objects to model real-world entities.

- **Encapsulation:** We discussed the concept of encapsulation and how to control access to members of a class.

- **Inheritance:** We address inheritance, allowing the creation of derived classes (subclasses) based on existing classes (superclasses).

- **Polymorphism:** We study polymorphism, which allows objects from different classes to share a common interface.

- **Abstraction:** We apply the concept of abstraction to create classes and interfaces that define behaviors.

- **Interfaces:** We explore the implementation of interfaces, allowing classes to fulfill specific contracts.

- **Methods and Properties:** We cover the creation and use of methods and properties in classes.

- **Constructors and Destructors:** We discussed the use of constructors and destructors in classes.

- **Exception Handling:** We explore exception handling to deal with errors in a structured way.
