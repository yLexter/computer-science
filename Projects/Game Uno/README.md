## About Uno Game

Uno is a very popular card game, known for its simple and dynamic rules. In this project, we used the D language to implement the game, which allowed us to explore a programming paradigm completely unknown to us.

## Implemented Features

- Shuffling the cards
- Distribution of cards to players
- Implementation of the Uno game rules
- Possibility to play against the computer

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code using a D compiler compatible with your operating system.
3. Run the compiled file to start the game.
