# Quitanda Project in Python

This project was developed as part of the Algorithms discipline, taught by professor Kezia. The objective of the project is to create a system for a grocery store, with features to manage inventory and make purchases.

## Functionalities

The system has the following functionalities:

1. **Stock Menu:** Allows you to view stock, create new products, update products, remove products and purchase products.
2. **Shopping Menu:** Allows you to view products and add them to the cart, view the cart, make a purchase, remove products from the cart and clear the cart.
3. **Home Menu:** Allows you to enter the stock menu, enter the purchase menu and view your purchase history.

## Database

The system uses Excel files as a database, which are manipulated with the Pandas library to carry out stock and purchasing operations.

The project aims to apply the concepts learned in the Algorithms discipline and practice data manipulation in Python with Pandas.
