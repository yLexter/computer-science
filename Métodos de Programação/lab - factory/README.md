#Lab-10: Factory

In this lab, we implemented the Factory Method design pattern to create different sandwich combinations. Each sandwich has a basic structure consisting of two slices of bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of ham, an egg and tomato. Ingredients may vary between the following options:

 Bread: Wholemeal, French, Ball
 Cheese: Prato, Mozzarella, Cheddar
 Ham: Chicken, Turkey
 Egg: Capoeira, Granja

## Goal

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how the Factory Method pattern can be used to create objects of different types of sandwiches without coupling the code to specific sandwich classes. We implemented three different combinations of ingredients to obtain three different sandwiches.
