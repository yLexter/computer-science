# Car Dealership

- Create an Entity-Relationship Diagram (DER) for a car dealership. The dealership sells both new and used cars and operates a service shop. Base your design on the following business rules:

1. A seller can sell many cars, but each car is sold by only one seller.
2. A customer can buy many cars, but each car is purchased by only one customer.
3. A salesperson writes a single invoice for each car he or she sells.
4. A customer receives an invoice for each car he or she purchases.
5. A customer can just go to get their car serviced; that is, a customer does not need to buy a car to be classified as a customer.
7. When a customer takes one or more cars for repair or service, a service ticket is written for each car.
8. The dealership maintains a service history for each of the cars serviced. Service records are referenced by the car's serial number.
9. A car brought in for service can be worked on by many mechanics, and each mechanic can work on many cars.
10. A car that is serviced may or may not need parts (for example, adjusting a carburetor or cleaning a fuel injector does not require new parts to be made available).
