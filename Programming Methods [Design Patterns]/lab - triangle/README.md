#Lab-0: Tests for the Triangle Program

In this laboratory, the objective is to create tests for the Tri√¢ngulo program.

## Instructions

1. Create a `TriangleTest.java` class with your test cases.
2. Run the tests to ensure they all pass.

## How to Create Test Cases

To create test cases, you can consider the following scenarios:

- Equilateral Triangle: All sides are equal.
- Isosceles Triangle: Two sides are equal.
- Scalene Triangle: All sides are different.
- Triangle with Invalid Side: One of the sides is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two sides.
- Triangle with unnatural side: One of the sides has a length less than or equal to 0.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Triangle`: Contains the Triangle classes.
- `tests`: Tests for the triangle
