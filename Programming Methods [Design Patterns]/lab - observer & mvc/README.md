## Bus Station Seating Information System
Seat Information System is a solution designed to provide real-time information about available, reserved and unavailable seats on a specific bus. This system is implemented both in the central panel of the bus station and in the kiosks spread throughout the terminal.

## Main Features

### Automatic Update
Whenever a customer goes to the ticket window and buys or reserves a ticket, the system is updated instantly.
This update is reflected on central dashboards and kiosks, ensuring all passengers have access to the latest information.

### Central Panel:
The central panel displays the arrangement of the bus's seats.

Seats are colored according to status:
- Green: Available
- Yellow: Reserved
- Red: Unavailable

### Kiosks
The kiosks display a numbered list of seats, along with their respective status.
Passengers can quickly check which seats are available or reserved.
