# Data structure

This repository is dedicated to the Data Structure discipline, where we explore advanced concepts of data organization and manipulation. The repository covers a variety of topics, including:

## Teacher
- **Teacher:** Heron

## Benchmarks work

- **Benchmarks of Sorting Algorithms:** This work involves analyzing the performance of different sorting algorithms, such as QuickSort, MergeSort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort and others. You will find codes and benchmark results to evaluate the efficiency of these algorithms.

- **Search Tree Benchmarks:** In this work, we analyze the performance of different types of search trees, including AVL, Splay, Red-Black and the standard tree. We resolve issues such as search time, insertion and deletion for each type of tree.

- **Hash Table Benchmarks:**

 - **Open Address Hash Implementation:** We developed an open address hash table algorithm with a load factor of 10. Benchmarks include insertion, search, and deletion analysis, as well as collision evaluations.

 - **Closed Address Hash Implementation (Double Hashing):** We created a closed address hash table algorithm using double hashing. Benchmarks evaluate performance in terms of insertion, search and deletion, considering collisions.

## Solved Exercises

- **Stacks and Queues:** You will find examples and resolutions of exercises related to stacks and queues data structures, as well as their use in real-world situations.

- **Binary Trees:** We solve exercises related to binary trees, including traversals (inorder, pre-order, post-order), insertion and deletion of nodes.

- **Linked Lists:** We explore linked lists, including insertion, removal and searching in single and double linked lists.

## How to use

This repository contains a series of directories, each related to a specific topic. Within each directory, you will find example code, exercise resolutions, and benchmark results for the corresponding topics.
